                </div>
                <p>
                    American football is a recent phenomenon in Morocco, where
                    it appears in 2012 thanks to a group of friends who discover
                    the practice on YouTube. A year later, the first team of the
                    kingdom, the "Rabat Lions", is born. It will be followed
                    soon after by the "Casablanca Stars" and "Tangier Dragons".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Attracted by contact sports, Sabrina, whose father is a
                    former rugby player, began to take an interest in American
                    football in 2013. The love at first sight was immediate, and
                    the young woman was quick to live for and through football.
                    Only problem: although her presence in the men's team is
                    tolerated, she does not feel fully accepted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At a summer camp in Italy, the coach denied her access to
                    the field. Vexed, she sits on the bench and watchs all day.
                    Back on the field the next morning, the coach, amazed by the
                    determination of Sabrina, proposes to join them. From the
                    snakes, she will have to swallow several during these first
                    years. But nothing seems to be able to undermine her will,
                    on the contrary. This is unfortunately not the case for the
                    other girls who have tried to join the team, but will
                    eventually become discouraged. Sabrina will remain for a
                    long time the only player of the club.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tired of these discriminations, Sabrina and two friends
                    decided to form the Black Mambas in 2015, a team that
                    welcomes both women and men. The beginnings are laborious.
                    Due to lack of land, training sessions take place on the
                    beach of Oudayas at the foot of the ramparts of the famous
                    Kasbah classified as World Heritage by Unesco. They have no
                    helmet or protection, injuries are common. It is not
                    uncommon for some to play barefoot. But their obstinacy
                    pays: the team is structured, the training becomes more
                    intense and the phases of play more tactical.
